          <p>Stoichiometry is defined as the quantitative study of chemical reactions. Since this part of chemistry does have a lot of math involved,
             many students have a hard time with it. However, stoichiometry is great since there is actually a pattern to the questions asked. By familiarizing
             themselves with the methods of solving such questions, students can make stoichiometry the easiest part of chemistry.</p>

          <h4>Mole Concept</h4>

        <div class="col section-text">
          <p>What is a mole? ($n$, Unit: mol)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A mole is defined as the amount of a substance and consists of 6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles (atoms, molecules, or formula units).</li>
            <li>It is a counting unit. Just as a dozen would equal to 12 things, and a pair would indicate 2 things, and a dozen represents 12, a mole indicates 10<sup>23</sup> of something.</li>
            <li>It is especially useful when comparing masses of different elements as it acts as a conversion factor. This makes it much easier to perform the calculations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Relative Atomic Mass ($A_r$)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Molar mass is defined as the average of all the naturally occurring isotopes of the element, relative to the mass of 1/12 of the mass of an atom of carbon-12</li>
            <li>Note that since this value is calculated relative to the mass of carbon-12, it does not actually have a unit of measurement (sometimes called dimensionless).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Relative Molecular Mass ($M_r$)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Defined as the mass of a molecule of that compound relative to the mass of 1/12 of an atom
of carbon-12. It is the total of all the atomic masses present within the molecule.</li>
            <li>Just like A<sub>r</sub>, M<sub>r</sub> does not have a unit of measurement (dimensionless).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Molar Mass ($M$, Unit: g mol$^{-1}$ or g/mol)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Defined as the $A_r$ or $M_r$ in g mol$^{-1}$. For example, the relative atomic mass of silicon (Si) is 28.09, and the molar mass of silicon is 28.09 g mol$^{-1}$. This means that 28.09 g of Si contains 6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup> Si atoms.</li>
            <li>More specifically, it is the mass of one mole of a substance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mass-Mole-Particle Relationship</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is quite difficult to deal with the calculation of masses and particles of different substances
without a conversion factor. Hence, we use the mole to make it much easier.</li>
            <li>A mass of a substance can be expressed in moles which allows it to be directly compared to
masses of other substances.</li>
            <li>The number of particles can also be expressed in moles to the same effect.</li>
            <li>By using this, we can see that there is a relationship between the mass, mole, and number of
particles.</li>

coefficients of the terms in the equation to make the number of elements equal. It may be helpful to
use fractions once in a while for more complicated equations. Note that the final balanced equation

          <h4>Dissecting Sample Stoichiometry Problems</h4>

        <div class="col">
          <p>When asked to perform a stoichiometric calculation, we must first determine what method of
calculation must be used to arrive at the answer.</p>
          <p>For IB students, although IB Chemistry exams provide a step-by-step structure of questions, it is
extremely helpful to understand how stoichiometry questions work to make it easier to answer.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, we must determine the type of question</li>
            <li>Next, we must determine what we are being asked for.</li>
            <li>Follow the method for this type of question, which will be explained below.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Let us take a look at this sample problem:</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p class="nm">A hydrate of a potassium carbonate has the formula $\ce{K2CO3. xH2O}$. A 10.00 g sample of the hydrated
solid is heated, and forms 7.93 g of anhydrous salt. Find the value of $x$ and write the formula of the salt.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Work towards the first question’s answer first.</p>
          <p>We must first determine the mass of water that was evaporated from the hydrated solid.</p>
          <div class="col mx-auto formula">
            $$m(\ce{H2O}) = m(\text{hydrous}) − m(\text{anhydrous}) = 10.00 \text{ g} − 7.93 \text{ g} = 2.07 \text{ g}$$
          </div>
          <p>Now, we will apply our knowledge on empirical formulas to calculate the ratio between the
anhydrous salt ($\ce{K2CO3}$) and the water ($\ce{H2O}).</p>
          <p>Calculate the amount of the anhydrous salt so that we can compare it with the water.</p>

            <p>Ryan wants to find the concentration of potassium hydroxide in a beaker. He pipetted 10.0 cm3 of
the $\ce{KOH}$ solution into a conical flask and titrated it with a 1.00M hydrochloric acid solution. Given
the titration data below, answer the following questions:</p>
            <p>Initial Burette Readings / cm$^3$ ($\pm$0.05 cm$^3$)</p>
            <ol>
              <li>0.96</li>
              <li>3.53</li>
              <li>14.29</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Final Burette Readings / cm$^3$ ($\pm$0.05 cm$^3$)</p>
            <ol>
              <li>16.22</li>
              <li>19.47</li>
              <li>29.81</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p class="nm">(a) Write a balanced equation for the titration. (include state symbols)<br>(b) What is the average amount (in moles) of $\ce{HCl}$ solution required to neutralize 10.0 cm$^3$ of the $\ce{KOH}$ solution?<br>(c) What is the concentration of the $\ce{KOH}$ solution?</p>
          </div>
          <p>Answering (a), $\ce{KOH}$ is titrated with $\ce{HCl}$ in a neutralization reaction.</p>
          <div class="col mx-auto formula">
            $$\ce{KOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → KCl(s) + H2O(l)}$$
          </div>
          <p>Answering (b), we must look at the titration data given. It is the $\ce{HCl}$ that is slowly released from the
burette into the $\ce{KOH}$ solution. By getting the average values for the burette measurements, we can
get the average volume of $\ce{HCl}$.</p>
          <div class="col mx-auto formula">
            $$V(\ce{HCl})=\frac{(16.22 − 0.96) + (19.47 − 3.53) + (19.81 − 14.29)}{3}=15.57 \text{ cm}^3$$
            $$n(\ce{HCl}) = c(\ce{HCl}) × V(\ce{HCl}) = 1 mol dm^{−3} × \frac{15.57}{1000}\text{dm}^3 = 0.01557 \text{ mol} \approx 0.0156 \text{ mol}$$
          </div>
          <p>Answering (c), we must first look at the ratio of the moles of $\ce{HCl}$ to the moles of $\ce{KOH}$. Since it is 1:1,
the amount of $\ce{HCl}$ is equal to the amount of $\ce{KOH}$ in the 10.0 cm$^3$
solution.</p>
          <div class="col mx-auto formula">
            $$n(\ce{KOH}) = n(\ce{HCl}) = 0.0156 \text{ mol}$$
            $$c(\ce{KOH}) = \frac{0.0156 mol}{\frac{10}{1000}\text{dm}^3}= 1.56\text{ mol dm}^{−3} ≈ 1.6\text{ mol dm}^{−3} \color{gray}{\text{ }(\text{or M})}$$
