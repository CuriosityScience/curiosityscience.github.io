          <p>Earlier, we discussed stoichiometric relationships and how one can determine the ratios by which a chemical reaction takes place. However, when we talk about chemical reactions, we do not only consider the quantitative aspect of them. We need to also talk about whether the said reaction is possible or not. A way to determine this is by taking a look at the energy of the system or to look at the chemical reaction from an energetics perspective. Does the system have the necessary energy for this specific reaction to occur?</p>

        <div class="col">
          <p>As mentioned earlier, we need to take into perspective the energy of the system of the chemical reaction. In chemistry, the energy we are referring to is thermal energy, which we measure as heat ($q$). We can expand this concept to show the heat content or internal energy of a system of a chemical reaction as enthalpy ($H$).</p>
          <p>We cannot know for sure what the enthalpy of a system is at a given time, but we can measure its changes as enthalpy change ($\Delta H$)</p>
          <p class="listh">In a chemical reaction, bonds are being broken and formed, which either requires (breaking) or releases (forming) energy. If the bonds of the products are stronger than the bonds of the reactants, then heat energy is released. If the bonds of the reactants are stronger than the bonds of the products then heat is taken into the system.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When heat energy is released into the surroundings ($\Delta H < 0$), then a reaction is <b>exothermic</b>.</li>
            <li>When heat energy is taken into the system ($\Delta H > 0$), then a reaction is <b>endothermic</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When an enthalpy change is measured under standard conditions (SATP), it is called the standard enthalpy change of a reaction ($\Delta H^{\ominus}$).</p>

          <h4>$\Delta H$ Calculations and Calorimetry</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>There are two ways of finding the enthalpy change of a reaction: by calculating it or through an experiment.</p>
          <p>When we calculate the enthalpy change of a system, to simplify the concept, we assume that it equals the heat energy gained or lost by the system. This can be summarized in the following equation.</p>
          <div class="col mx-auto formula">
            $$\Delta H = q = m \times c \times \Delta T$$
          </div>
          <p>In this equation, we can see the value $c$ which represents the specific heat capacity of a material. This tells us how much energy is required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of that material by 1 K. For example, the specific heat capacity of water is $\pu{4.18 J kg-1 K-1}$. This means that it takes 4.18 joules of energy to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 K.</p>
          <p>Note: Some questions may ask for the answer in $\pu{kJ mol-1}$ units. To find this, first convert the value in joules to kilojoules then divide the value by the total number of moles of the substance reacted.</p>
          <p>The advantage of using energy to show chemical reactions is the knowledge that energy can be transferred between substances. We can calculate the energy used or released in a chemical reaction through a process called calorimetry, which involves both an experiment and theoretical analysis. In calorimetry, we usually use water as the medium by which the energy of the chemical reaction can be transferred since water has a relatively low specific heat capacity.</p>
          <p>We will discuss various examples of calorimetry below:</p>
          <div class="box">
            <p>$\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of $\pu{1 moldm-3}$ $\ce{HCl}$ was added to $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of $\pu{1 moldm-3}$ $\ce{NaOH}$ solution in a polystyrene cup. The initial temperature of both solutions was 25.2ºC. After the two solutions were mixed together and stirred, the temperature rose to 28.5ºC. Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction.</p>
            <p>Write the equation for the reaction</p>
            <p class="subq">$\ce{HCl(aq) +NaOH(aq)->NaCl(aq) +H2O(l)}$</p>
            <p>Calculate molar quantities</p>
            <p class="subq">$n(\ce{HCl})=\frac{25.0}{1000} \times 1.00 = 2.50 \times 10^{-2} \text{ mol}$</p>
            <p class="subq">$n(\ce{NaOH})=\frac{25.0}{1000} \times 1.00 = 2.50 \times 10^{-2} \text{ mol}$</p>
            <p class="subq">The reaction will then have a heat for $\pu{2.50 \times 10^{-2} mol}$</p>
            <p>Calculate the heat</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>Hess' Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction depends only on the difference between the enthalpy of the products and the enthalpy of the reactants. It does not take into account the reaction pathway.</p>
          <p>For instance, the reaction of A to B has the enthalpy change $\Delta H_1$, the reaction of B to C has the enthalpy change $\Delta H_2$, and the reaction of A to C has the enthalpy change $\Delta H_3$. Therefore, $\Delta H_3 =\Delta H_1 +\Delta H_2$</p>
          <p>The main reason for Hess' Law is the law of the conservation of energy.</p>

          <p>Chemical equations with their thermodynamic data can be manipulated in a similar fashion to systems of equations, except that the sign of the enthalpy change switches every time the equation is reversed, and the value of the enthalpy change corresponds to the change in the moles of the equation.</p>

          <p class="subq">$\ce{C(s) +1/2O2(g) ->CO(g)} \qquad \Delta H=\pu{-394+283 kJmol-1}=\pu{-111 kJmol-1}$</p>

          <h4>Standard Enthalpy Changes of Formation and Combustion</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>The standard enthalpy change of formation ($\Delta H_f^{\ominus}$) of a compound is the enthalpy change when <b>one mole</b> of the compound is formed from its elements in their <b>standard states at 298 K and 100 kPa</b>.</p>
          <p>As a result, the $\Delta H_f^{\ominus}$ of an element in its standard state will be 0.</p>
          <p>The standard enthalpy change of combustion ($\Delta H_c^{\ominus}$) is the enthalpy change when one mole of substance is completely combusted in oxygen under standard conditions (298 K and 100 kPa).</p><br>
          <p>A possible way to apply these with Hess' Law is the finding the standard enthalpy change of formation of ethanol. This cannot be detemined directly, hence we must calculate for it using Hess' Law.</p>
          <p>First we write the chemical equation for the formation of ethanol from its elements.</p>
          <p class="subq">$\ce{2C(s) +3H2(g) +1/2O2(g)->C2H5OH(l)}$</p>
          <p>We then write the chemical equation of the combustion of ethanol, since this is measurable.</p>
          <p class="subq">$\ce{C2H5OH(l) +3O2(g)->2CO2(g) +3H2O(l)}$</p>
          <p>Then we need to express all the enthalpy changes in an equation. Note that all values of the products are negative of their original values.</p>
          <p class="subq">$\Delta H_f^{\ominus}(\ce{C2H5OH}) = 2\times\Delta H_f^{\ominus}(\ce{CO2}) + 3\times\Delta H_f^{\ominus}(\ce{H2O}) - \Delta H_c^{\ominus}(\ce{C2H5OH}) $</p>
          <p>In the equation above, we used Hess' Law. Imagine that the overall reaction is the first equation. The intermediate equations are the formations of the carbon dioxide and water, which are in the combustion reaction. However, it is important to note that the water and carbon dioxide are the products, which means that the combustion reaction is in the direction opposite of the formation reactions. Hence, we need to reverse this reaction, which then changes the sign of the enthalpy change of combustion.</p>
          <p class="subq">$\Delta H_f^{\ominus}(\ce{C2H5OH}) = 2(-393.5) + 3(-285.8) -(-1371)=\pu{-273.4 kJmol-1}</p>
          <p>Note: thermodynamic data for formation and combustion of common molecules is found in the IB Data Booklet.</p>

          <h4>Bond Enthalpies</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>Bond enthalpies provide an alternative way to calculate enthalpy changes. The main principle behind bond enthalpies is the energy released/gained in a bond between gaseous atoms/molecules.</p>
          <p class="subq">$\ce{X-Y(g)<=>X(g) +Y(g)}$</p>
          <p>When bonds are broken, energy is required (positive). When bonds are formed, energy is released (negative).</p>
          <p>Due to the slight differences in the energy released/required by molecules in different situations, bond enthalpies are only average values. Hence, average bond enthalpy is defined as the energy needed to break one mole of a bond in a gaseous molecule averaged over similar compounds.</p>
          <p>Note: average bond enthalpies for different bonds are provided in the IB Data Booklet.</p><br>
          <p>For example, to calculate the combustion of hydrogen gas.</p>
          <p>First write the equation and count the number of each type of bond.</p>
          <p class="subq">$\ce{2H-H(g)+O-O(g)->2H-O-H(l)}$</p>
          <p>There are 2 H-H bonds, 1 O-O bond, and 4 H-O bonds.</p>
          <p>Check the given data for the values. (H-H: 436, O-O: 144, H-O: 463)</p>
          <p class="subq">$\Delta H = 2\times 436 + 144 - 4\times 463 = \pu{-836 kJmol-1}$</p><br>
          <p>Always remember that bond enthalpies are only average values and hence the calculations will only be an estimation of the enthalpy change. Another thing to consider is that this only works with gaseous compounds.</p>
